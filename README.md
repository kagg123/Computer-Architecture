Single Cycle CPU Implements a 64-bit ARM processor that executes 1 instruction every clock cycle
Piplelined CPU implements a 64-bit ARM 5 stage pipelined processor

I did not build the physical proccesor, they were simualted and tested on modelsim. 

Check out file instruction set for a list of assembly instructions that can be implemented on these processors.
